#Practical 1
#Week: Week 1
#Learning Activities
This week, I worked on creating a multipage website with HTML and CSS and explored how to organize my code for clarity and efficiency. I also practiced designing and implementing a navigation bar, footer, and responsive layout. Additionally, I used GitHub Pages to test the deployment of my website. During this process, I learned how to troubleshoot common issues like not being able to upload to github pages. Although the images or logo shows on the website locally I couldn't troubleshoot it on github. I further refined my knowledge by reading articles and watching tutorials on structuring websites, deploying on GitHub.

#Estamated Hours:
Approximately 10 hours – spread across 2-3 hours per day.
#Content Insights:
While I am comfortable with HTML and CSS, working on a multi-page structure helped me understand the importance of consistent and modular coding practices. For example, using an external CSS file for shared styling across all pages reduced redundancy and improved maintainability. I encountered challenges when my header image wasn't displaying correctly. These debugging moments gave me deeper insights into the nuances of web development.
#Career/Employability/Learning Insights:
This practical has reinforced my understanding of creating and deploying functional, visually appealing websites, which is essential for a career in web development. The experience of debugging issues and deploying a project has improved my problem-solving and project management skills. Additionally, combining tutorials and hands-on practice has been an effective way to solidify my knowledge. Being able to explore and learn independently is a valuable skill I will continue to develop.

Overall, this week has been a productive and engaging start to improving my web development skills. I look forward to applying what I’ve learned to more complex projects in the future.
